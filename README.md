buildR is a clean, modern, single-page resume builder that lets users create, preview, and export a professional A4 resume as a PDF — directly in the browser.

## Motivation

Many engineers struggle to create effective resumes not because of lack of experience, but because of poor structure and formatting.

The [r/EngineeringResumes](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/wiki/index/) community showcases real, high-impact resumes that consistently help candidates land interviews. One widely shared [template](https://www.overleaf.com/project/662939053eb1dc8f0f3c617f) became a strong reference for what actually works in practice.

This project aims to bring that proven, no-nonsense resume style into an interactive web editor. The goal is to make it easy to:

- Build a clean, professional, single-page resume
- Focus on content instead of formatting
- Export directly to a print-ready PDF
